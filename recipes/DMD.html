        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 shallot</li>
            <li>2 fluid ounces gin</li>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces blue cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sliced green pimiento-stuffed olives + 3 tablespoons olive brine</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 3 minutes. Carefully pour 1 1/4 ounces gin into the skillet; remove skillet from heat.</li>
            <li>Add cream cheese, blue cheese, sour cream, and shallot mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. (Alternatively, add ingredients to a bowl and use a hand mixer). Beat on medium-low until well combined. Add 1 1/4 cup olives and 1 1/2 tablespoons brine to mixture and mix until just incorporated. Stir in salt and pepper; transfer mixture to a serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the olive topping. Combine remaining olives with remaining olive oil, gin, brine, and black pepper in a small bowl. Stir well and let stand until ready to serve. </li>
            <li>Drain off some of the liquid, and spoon olive mixture onto dip. Serve with crackers or crostini.</li>
        </ol>
